# calculield

This project perfoms the regular mathematical calculations on an infinite stream.

This has been categorised into 2 ways of accessing it.

1. Regular python file based
	
	Under Core, yeilder.py takes in an argument and performs the mathematical operations.
	> python yeilder.py "1+1?\*(3\*2)/4?"

	**Result**
	```
	1+1 = 2 
	1+1*(3*2)/4 = 2.5
	1+1*(3*2)/43+4 = 5.1395
	terminating the program due to a wrong sequence
	ERROR
	```

		
	
2. Web app based
	
	This is built over the flask framework. 


The show string -> ?
Iteration Stopper -> 25
Sequence breaker ->
